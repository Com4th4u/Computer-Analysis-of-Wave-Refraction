Waves are raised ridge-shaped formations moving across the surface of a liquid, especially an ocean. They are a major factor in determining the geometry and composition of beaches and significantly influence the planning and design of harbors, waterways, shore protection measures, coastal structures and other coastal works.
Waves are created by winds blowing across the water surface and transferring energy to the water by the impact of air. Small ripples develop first, and frictional drag on their windward side causes them to grow larger, or to collapse and contribute part of their expanded energy to larger waves. Consequently, large waves capture an increasing amount of energy and continue to develop as long as the wind maintains sufficient strength and a constant direction.
